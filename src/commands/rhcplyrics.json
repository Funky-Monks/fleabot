    "lyrics": "Deep Kick Lyrics[Intro]\nIt started when we were little kids\nFree spirits, but already tormented by our own hands\nGiven to us by our parents\nWe got together and wrote on desks\nAnd slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains\nAnd slipped through whatever cracks we could find\nMinds altered, we didn't falter\nIn portraying hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe\nWe loved the dirty city\nAnd the journeys away from it\nWe had not yet been or seen our friends, selves\nChase tails round and round in downward spirals\nLeaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind\nStill, the brothers, blood comrades, partner, family, cousin was impenetrable\nAnd we lived inside it, laughing with no clothes\nAnd everything experimental until death was upon us\nIn our face, mortality\nAnd lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us\nAnd did, while the giant grey monster grew\nMore poisoned and volatile around us\nJaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around\nNothing is the same\nSo we keep moving\nWe keep moving\n[Interlude]\n(Ooh shit! Ooh shit!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWent off and got some hair cuts\nLooking wild and got all drugged up\nHopped a train into the night\nGot a ride with a transvestite\nTwo boys in San Francisco\nTwo boys in San Francisco\nBlasted off in a BART bathroom\nThose coppers woke us up\nMotherfuckers woke us up\n\n[Chorus]\nTwo young brothers on a hovercraft\nTelepathic love and belly laughs\n\n[Verse 2]\nStorm the stage of Universal\nSlim shine talk boy go subversal\nPapa's proud and so he sent us\nPounding hearts full and relentless\nTwo boys in London, England\nTwo boys in London, England\nClimbing out of hostel windows\nWearing gear so out but in though\nCome on kid and do the no, no\n[Chorus]\nTwo young brothers on a hovercraft (yeah)\nTelepathic love and belly laughs (oh yeah)\n\n[Interlude]\n(Ooh shit! Ooh shit!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe went to Fairfax High School\nJumped off buildings into their pools\nWe'd sit down, grease at Canters\nRun like hell 'cause they can't catch us\nTwo boys in L.A. proper\nTwo boys in L.A. proper\nStealing anything that we could\nGot to sneak into the Starwood\nGot to peak into the deep good\n\n[Outro]\nI remember\n10 years ago in Hollywood\nWe did some good\nAnd we did some real bad stuff\nBut the Butthole Surfers said\nIt's better to regret something you did\nThan something you didn't do\nYea, we were young\nAnd we were looking, looking\nLooking for that deep kick\nYeah, seen 'em come, seen 'em go\n(And I feel I'm getting close to you)2Embed",

    "lyrics": "Green Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAbout this planet, there is something I know\nThere's a very big difference between above and below\nA friend, foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor\nLet your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow\nHere, above land, man has laid his plan\nAnd yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan\nWe got a government so twisted and bent\nBombs, tanks, and guns is how our money is spent\nWe got V.D., heroin, greed, and prostitution\nTension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution\nNot to mention hardcore chemical pollution\nIf you think a different way, you're in a mental institution\nAnd that's a heart felt shame\n'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same\nSo, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?\n[Bridge]\nWow\nOw, ow, ow\nOoh\n\n[Verse 2]\nTime now take you to a different place\nWhere peace-loving whales flow through liquid outer space\nA grooving and a gliding as graceful as lace\nA never-losing touch with ocean's embrace\nDiviner than the dolphin, that there is none\n'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun\nNo one tells 'em how their life is run\nAnd no one points at 'em with a gun\nThey have a lot of love for every livin' creature\nThe smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature\nThey be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher\nSomeday mister dolphin, I know I'm going to meet ya\n\n[Verse 3]\nBack to the land of the police man\nWhere he does whatever he says he can\nIncluding hating you because you're a Jew\nOr beating black ass, that's nothing new\nA trigger-happy cops, they just like to brawl\nThey use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all\nThey got puke-ridden prisons and sex-sick jails\nFuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail\nSo support your police, support your local wars\nThat's the way to open economic doors\nWhy do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore\nWe assume the position to sell the ammunition\nWhat the fuck? It's the American tradition\nAlong with goin' fishin', apple pies in the kitchen\nIsn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?1Embed",

Naw, she's not busted, he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say, \"Hey, what's up, girl?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nGet out of bed and I clear up my head and\nI don't want to go but I do it instead\nWe are dreams within a dream\nGet into bed and I turn off my head\nAnd I\ufeff started to float, was it something she said?\nWe are dreams within a dream\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I remember we got our driver's license, and my friend Hillel had this little Datsun painted green, and...\nHollywood would get so crazy in the winter. The rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights, and, well, you know, we'd smoke weed and we'd go up in the hills, and we'd listen to progressive rock music, and just kind of trip out and... Well, we would dream, you know, we would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music. And, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star, and I didn't even know what that was. I was like, \"Whatever you want to do, man, I'm coming with you, I'm right with you my friend.\"\n[Chorus]\nGet out of bed and I clear up my head and\nI don't want to go but I do it instead\nWe are dreams within a dream\nGet into bed and I turn off my head\nAnd I\ufeff started to float, was it something she said?\nWe are dreams within a dream\n\n[Outro]\nWhy in the world would you want it to be?\nWhy would you want to take it so, so literally?\nAll these things that come down from the sky, raining upon your head\nMake you stop and wonder why, ah!\nCan't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read\nFor the simple man like me? I don't think so\nI reach out to my family and I say, \"It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky\nWith a punishing hand, no\nIt's about heaven in your heart.\" Now when can we start?\nI wanna choose love instead of fear\nWon't you come right now, over here\nAnd be a part of my, ah...\nLet me make it easier this time, I love youEmbed",

Ron Hubbard solution\nNot to mention. hardcore chemical pollution\nIf you think a different way, you're in a mental institution\nAnd that's a heartfelt shame\n'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same\nSo, why should only Larry, Curly, and Moe be to blame?\n\n[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]\nTime now to take you to a different place\nWhere peace-lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space\nGroovin' and a-gliddin' as graceful as lace\nA never losin'-touch with the ocean's embrace\nDiviner than the dolphin, that there is none\n'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun\nNo one tells 'em how their life is run\nAnd no one points at 'em with a gun\nThey have a lot of love for every livin' creature\nThe smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature\nThey be movin' in schools, but everyone's the teacher\nSomeday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you\n[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis]\nBack to the land of the policeman\nWhere he does whatever he says he can\nIncluding hating you because you're a Jew\nOr beating black ass, that's nothin' new\nTrigger-happy cops, they just like to brawl\nThey use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all\nThey got puke-ridden prisons and sex-sick jails\nFuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail\nSo support your police, support your local wars\nThat's the way to open economic doors\nWhy do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore\nWe assume the position to sell the ammunition\nWhat the fuck? It's the American tradition\nAlong with going fishin', apple pies in the kitchen\nIsn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?\n\n[Outro: Hillel Slovak]\nHow did you [?]\nWhat do you want to do then that with?\nWhat do you want to do with me?\nWhy are you using me?\n[?] buy your love\n[?] a whaleEmbed",
